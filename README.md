#  Demystifying ML: US Global Warming
 
In this project we were tasked with finding a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing. After some consideration we landed on the topic of global warming. In America, one's view climate change is often depends on where they live. The majority of U.S. adults say they are taking some specific action in their daily lives to protect the environment and that 62% say climate change is at least having some impact on their local community. Most Pacific states followed by the Northeast see climate change as affecting their local areas.  [PEW Research Center, 11/22/2019.]

We will be looking a average weather temperatures and CO2 emmisions to evalute whether or not climate change is an actual problem in America or not. 


## Getting Started
Create a front-end interface that maps to an API to “smarten” the algorithm.
Perform a deep dive of existing data using machine learning.
Create a visualization that continues to learn where clusters lie based on ML.
(Use D3 or Plotly to change the visualization.)
Create an idea with mock data that simulates how machine learning might be used.
Create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression.
